This project focuses on analyzing A/B testing data using Machine Learning techniques to understand patterns, compare variations, and make data-driven decisions.

In this project, we:

Clean and preprocess A/B test data

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Engineer relevant features

Train Machine Learning models

Evaluate model performance

Generate predictions on test data

The goal is to extract meaningful insights and build a predictive model that can generalize well to unseen data.
